# Automatic Gate System

This project demonstrates an automatic gate system using an Arduino Uno, a servo motor, an ultrasonic sensor, an LED, and a buzzer. The gate opens when an object (e.g., a car) is detected within a certain distance and closes when no object is detected. The LED and buzzer provide visual and audible alerts when the gate is opened or closed.
